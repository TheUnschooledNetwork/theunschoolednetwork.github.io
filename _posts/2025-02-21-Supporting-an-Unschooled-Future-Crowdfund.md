# ⚡ [DONATE TO OUR CROWDFUND](https://btcpay.theunschooled.net/apps/2eEk6cGXA6Xru2ALmHkQvgcpEJ34/crowdfund) ⚡


#### About this Crowdfund
The goal at Unschooled is to provide comprehensive suite of resources for educators who want to advertise or host master-classes, lessons, courses, tutoring and/or mentoring programs to the global market of bitcoiners. The future of education is decentralized.

In order to fulfill this vision, I would like to offer contributors the ability to make use of my self-hosted instance of BTCPay. To maintain our security, I'll need to use an STMP provider (which, of course, will not be free) when allowing users to set up their accounts. It is for this reason that I am appealing you, the bitcoiner community, to consider donating your hard earned sats to help me bring my project into fruition. I am setting a goal 165100 sats, as the time of writing is the cost of the Proton Duo suite, which should more than suffice for the the project's next stage of growth. 

#### Why will this help?
Achieving this fundraising goal will theoretically allow anyone to 'set-up shop' with us by creating a user account on our BTCPay server, downloading Blink wallet and [using the 'read only' API](https://dev.blink.sv/examples/btcpayserver-plugin#how-to-connect) to link up. Furthermore, contributors can [create a PR to our GitHub](https://theunschoolednetwork.github.io/posts/Contributing-to-Unschooled/), and use our blog as a home-base for their services.

In the meantime, I invite you to learn more about the project by browsing the [The Unschooled Skills Exchange blog](https://theunschoolednetwork.github.io/). What you will find is a work in progress, but I am happy to report that a single (trusted) service provider has set up a page on the Unschooled  and is taking clients. 

Lastly, if you are passionate about furthering education around the globe and have some skills to offer, please consider contributing to the project.

> Providing access to our BTCPay server will not be available for the time being. With this crowdfund, I am hoping that soon this will change.
