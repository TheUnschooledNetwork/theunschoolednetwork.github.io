# ⚡ [DONATE TO OUR CROWDFUND](https://btcpay.theunschooled.net/apps/2eEk6cGXA6Xru2ALmHkQvgcpEJ34/crowdfund) ⚡


#### About this Crowdfund
The goal at Unschooled is to provide a comprehensive suite of resources for educators who want to advertise or host master-classes, lessons, courses, tutoring and/or mentoring programs to the global market of bitcoiners. The future of education is decentralized.

If you want to support this vision, then please consider supporting us via this crowdfunding campaign. 

#### Why will this help?

These are a few of our short-term goals that your support will help in funding: 

- Enabling anyone to 'set-up shop' with us to securely benefit from Unschooling.
- Improve user experience by designing a more responsive, user-friendly website
- Generate educational content for our blog that helps users onboard
- Promote our vision by creating strong signal in bitcoin adjacent spaces
- Help organizers plan and execute bitcoin meetups

In the meantime, I invite you to learn more about the project by browsing the [The Unschooled Skills Exchange blog](https://theunschoolednetwork.github.io/). What you will find is a work in progress, but I am happy to report that a single (trusted) service provider has set up a page on the Unschooled  and is taking clients. 

Lastly, if you are passionate about furthering education around the globe and have some skills to offer, please consider contributing to the project.
