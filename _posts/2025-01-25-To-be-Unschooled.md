# To be Unschooled

One of the marvels of the internet today is that it enables learning on a massive scale, orders of magnitude greater than at any other time in history. The benefit to lifelong learners is plain and clear. The content you can find (pretty much any and everything) becomes your new syllabus. Being an educator is a little more topsy turvey, for many reasons.

Emergent, open-source tehcnologies are facilitating more and more types of peer-to-peer transactions, the way the internet had initially been imagined. However, the general quality of the internet today is not peer-to-peer. Content predominantly lives on centralized servers meaning content creators are predominantly at the mercy of their proprieters. The Unschooled Network is a project that seeks to coordinate this challenge of reclaiming education on the web.

## An Unschooled Standard

The Unschooled Network vision is to become a universal netowrk of educators and learners that wish to transact in Bitcoin. Education on the web need _not_ be permission-based. With its global reach, The Unschooled Network seeks to be both a means for educators to make a decent living on a bitcoin standard and for learners worldwide to have a place on the web to access world-class educational resources.
