### Our Purpose

Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the internet today is that it enables learning on a massive scale, orders of magnitude greater than at any other time in history. You are only limited by the content you can find.

Emergent, open-source tehcnologies are facilitating new forms of peer-to-peer transactions. However, peer-to-peer is not the standard at present. Most content resides on centralized servers, meaning its creators are at the mercy of platform proprietors.

### The Unschooled Standard

The Unschooled Network is a project dedicated to reclaiming education on the web.

Our vision is to become a universal netowork of educators and learners who wish to transact in Bitcoin. Education on the web need _not_ be permission-based, nor should access to a particular country's currency be a barrier. Therefore, Unschooled exclusively supports on-chain bitcoin and lightning payments. Thus, The Unschooled Network is committed to becoming a means for educators to make a living on a bitcoin standard as well as a place for learners worldwide to have access to high-quality educational resources.

While the _value for value_ (V4V) proposition supported by the Nostr protocol enables users to tip their creators for the content they upload, Unschooled seeks to be a dedicated hub for trustworthy educational content, facilitating direct, non-custodial Bitcoin payments on-chain and over Lightning.

### How it works

Since upholding openness is fundamental to our mission, Unschooled is a website hosted on github pages. Anyone in the world with the ability to download our repo, propose changes and submit them, can in theory contribute to growing the network.

The static-site home page of Unschooled is designed to be a starting point, a foundation. By using Static-site pages, our contributers really just need to become familiar with using the Markdown editor ([cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). This method for accepting contributions strikes a balance between usability and functionality. Contributors may also wish to make use of this [list of our recommended content creation tools](https://theunschoolednetwork.github.io/posts/To-be-Unschooled//posts/Tools-For-Content-Creators/) in order to maximize their unschooling potential. As a creator, you may choose to link to your own beautiful self-hosted website, or develop an entire course and host it here.The choice is completely yours.

Additionally, Unschooled also hosts its own instance of a BTC Pay Server, allowing any contributer to run their own store and accept payments--either on-chain or via the Lightning Network.

The goal is to create a global network for peer-to-peer learning, one that allows educators and learners to connect freely, without surrendering their data to blackbox algorithms, advertisers or third parties.
