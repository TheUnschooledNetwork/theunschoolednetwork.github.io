## Fulfilling _P2P Electronic Cash_ 

Bitcoin only begins to fulfill Nakamoto's vision of being a P2P electronic payment network when people actually use it to transact. Unschooled is positioning itself to realize the potential for which Satoshi Nakamoto had originally imagined it would be used.

Tech-savvy educators across the globe are uniquely positioned to be using bitcoin for transacting and selling their service online, free from jurisdictional constraints offered so magnanimously by our dear governments. Influencers, bloggers and programmers alike have already been able to plug into Bitcoin and Lightning for transmitting value around the globe, and Unschooled wants to push educators down the same stream.

So what makes the field of P2P Education so well-suited to transact using Bitcoin and Lightning? 

### 1. Educators have one foot in both worlds

If you are a developer or influencer, you may already be transacting adversarially using Bitcoin or Lightning--but where are the Educators? Well - more often than not, they still have one foot in the 'meat space.' Be not mistaken, this is a strength. Educators, like Hermes from the Greek pantheon, are conduits between worlds. This makes them experts in bridging gaps in understanding as is so desperately needed for onboarding new freedom-minded users to bitcoin. And since they are, more often than not, end-users themselves, they have an intimate understanding of the user experience in a a way that others do not. Let's make educators among the first make their services beneficiaries of the global market that is being usered in during this information age.

### 2. Great learners make great educators

Those who have spent the most time learning the ins and outs of how technology works become the best at explaiing it to new users. One day, we can hope, the experience of decentralized payment networks will become so intuitive that we no longer educators to explain it to people. It will become second-nature, and the focus of rendering educational services exogeneous to the new economic reality can begin to take place. Those who have the most to share will be teaching those who are the most eager to learn. The Unschooling experience is one of un-doing the malaise of our old economic-educational complex.

### 3. Governement issued education sucks

Leave teachers to teach, and they will change the world. Those who are capable of designing and marketing quality lessons ought to be able to enter those to be sold in the free market.

### 4. Ship it instantly

Like developers and influencers, educators have a product that can be shipped instantly across the globe with minimal energy output. Unschooled is a home for that product. There are many ways in which you may go about (using these recommended tools, for example); you are only limited by what you can imagine. 

### 5. Nothing can replace a mentor-student relationship

AI can do many things, but what it cannot do is replace the human-bond that can exist between a mentor and student. It cannot trust you to be invited to your hometown for coffee, attend a conference with you, meander off into tangents with you about what it means to be alive (well, maybe almost) like the way a great mentor can. In education, AI will make for a magnificent game-changer, but there's nothing like great teachers.
